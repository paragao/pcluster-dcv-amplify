# Basic instructions

There are two parts for this project: a backend that implements a NICE DCV solution which will stop/terminate instances based on their usage, and a frontend that implements a portal which creates those instances based on a Launch Template. 

If you want to deploy only the backend, follow the steps [here](https://www.github.com/paragao/pcluster-dcv-amplify/dcv-backend). 

If you want to deploy both backend and frontend, follow the steps [here](https://www.github.com/paragao/pcluster-dcv-amplify/frontend).
